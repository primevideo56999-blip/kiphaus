              Guests today are burned by hidden fees that inflate a ₹4,000 listing to ₹6,000–7,000 by checkout,
              fake listings, inconsistent quality, and last-minute cancellations. Kiphaus exists to fix that: find
              a stay you can trust before you pay, at the price actually shown, and reach a real host directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hosts pay a flat annual subscription instead of a 10–20% per-booking commission, so growing direct
              bookings actually pays off. From a first-time homestay owner to a multi-property villa manager, the
              platform is built for the full spectrum — not just the tech-savvy.

        To create an account and complete a booking, we collect your name, email, phone number, and the trip
        details you enter (dates, guest count, destination). Hosts complete identity, property, video, and
        on-site verification, which requires government ID and property documents — that data is used only for
        verification and is not shown to guests.

      <p>
        Your phone number is shared with a host only after you choose to contact them, so they can reach you on
        WhatsApp about your stay. We use your email for booking confirmations and account security. We don&rsquo;t
        sell personal data to third parties.

        Kiphaus routes guest-host conversations directly to WhatsApp rather than a platform inbox. Messages
        exchanged on WhatsApp are subject to WhatsApp&rsquo;s own privacy terms in addition to this policy.

        We retain account and booking data for as long as your account is active, and for a limited period
        afterward to meet legal and tax record-keeping requirements. Host verification documents are retained
        only as long as needed for compliance.
